Built with React, Redux, and GraphQL, this map follows a seventeen day trip I took with three close friends. Click the featured points of interest to find the elevation, mileage along the trail, a picture I took along the way, and a brief description. Happy camping!

A quick prototype, this app will eventually take an admin input to create summaries of other hiking, road, and ski trips I've had the fortune of experiencing.
